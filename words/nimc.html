      It's programmed using custom webcomponents and is easily extensible by creating your own custom webcomponents to
      render a different file type.
    </p>
    <p>
      It curently has two different renderers one for markdown (.md) and one for latex (.tex). The markdown renderer
      uses markdown-it and therefore is complient with the common mark spec. And the .tex renderer uses Katex with the
      chemical equations extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan on writing my own markdown render in order to support Katex in markdown and allow for even more easy
      extensibility.
