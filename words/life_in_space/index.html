    <h2>An Introduction to O’Neill Cylinders</h2>
    <img src="cylinder.jpeg" alt="Artist depiction of an O’Neill Cylinder">
    <a class="ref" href="#10">[10]</a>
    <p>
      O’Neill Cylinders are huge rotating space habitats capable of supporting up to 20 million people in a single
      habitat<a href="#1" class="ref">[1]</a>. These behemoths have a radius stretching 3.2km and a length of 32km.
      Artificial gravity will be
      provided by spin, the Cylinders will be pressurized to one atmosphere and provide sufficient radiation shielding.
      These cylinders come in pairs which spin in opposite directions in order to be more stable. An O’Neill cylinder
      would have 6 sections, 3 “Solar” sections which bounce light in with mirrors and 3 “Valleys'' for human
      habitation. Originally these structures were supposed to use a more old fashioned form of solar power where
      parabolic mirrors concentrate light to heat up water which then boils and spins a turbine. This method operating
      at only 33% efficiency would be more than sufficient<a href="#1" class="ref">[1]</a> in order to power a modern
      industrialized society. These
      space habitats will eventually become more suited for human life than Earth itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper was written in September 1974, a mere 5 years after the moon landing. And less than a year before the
      space race officially ended with a handshake in space<a href="#1" class="ref">[2]</a>. At the time of writing the Apollo program is still
      running and the Soviet’s are still landing uncrewed missions on the moon. This was a time when the Earth's
      population was increasing at a rate that would double the population every 35 years. And at the time
      overpopulation was a serious issue with no clear solution. In fact, O’Neill states “By about 2050,
      then[…]emigration to the colonies could reverse the rise of Earth’s population, and that the acceleration of the
      solution could be dramatically fast[...]Within less than 30 years, Earth’s population could be reduced from a peak
      of 16.5 billion people to whatever stable value is desired”<a href="#1" class="ref">[1]</a>. This is very
      different to our present reality
      where some countries like Japan have only 1.42 births per woman<a href="#1" class="ref">[3]</a> and the population is only expected to reach
      around 11 billion and then level off.
    </p>
    <img src="1920px-World-Population-1800-2100.svg.png" style="filter:invert()">
    <p>
      While the original problem these fantastic space colonies were trying to solve is long gone, the dream still lives
      on.
    </p>
    <h2>Life In Space</h2>
    <p>
      Life on O’Neill Cylinders in the later stages of colonization has the potential to be an idyllic paradise. With
      far greater control over the terrain and biosphere than we have on Earth, cylinders will be constructed in the
      manner that best suits its inhabitants. These habitats will contain our favorite parts of Earth, the forests,
      lakes, rivers, mountains, valleys while industry and agriculture would be done in separate habitats. Not only will
      they have our favorite natural features, but there will also be wonderful never seen before creations. As more
      people and industry move to space the Earth may eventually become more of a nature preserve and our climate
      disaster will be averted. By doing industry in separate cylinders we will no longer experience the negative
      environmental externalities. These cylinders may eventually provide refuge for marginalized groups, who would be
      able to flee in their mostly self-sufficient space habitats. Furthermore the need for war is much reduced in a
      world with near infinite living space and cheap solar energy. There will be a wide variety of different styles of
      cylinders, and transport between them is incredibly simple, fast and comfortable. In space there is no air
      resistance, a simple pressurized can with all the desired amenities attached to a cable is more than sufficient.
    </p>
    <h2>Settling the final frontier</h2>
    <p>
      The first cylinder will of course be the hardest, and in his paper O’Neill presents a far more conservative
      starting point than the massive 32km long theoretically possible habitat. Instead he proposes a cylinder with a
      100m radius that is a kilometer long. Which he claims can support up to 10,000 people. He proposes to build said
      cylinder at L<sub>5</sub>, the fifth Lagrange point, a point where a “small” object will stay in the same location
      relative to
      the earth and the moon.
    </p>
    <img src="lagrangian.png" style="filter:invert()">
    <a href="#5" class="ref">[5]</a>
    <p>
      There are generally two ways to cut down on costs for building the cylinder, launching for cheaper and gathering
      materials in space rather than on earth. Materials like aluminum and rocks are readily found on the moon, while
      glass can easily be manufactured from raw materials collected from the moon. As for the materials collected from
      earth O’Neill predicted that in the 1980’s there will be reusable chemical rockets that lower the launch cost from
      “$190 to $400 per pound, in 1972 dollars'' however he picks a more “conservative” $425 per pound or about $2,700
      in 2021 dollars<a href="#1" class="ref">[6]</a>. Fast forward to 2020 and assuming getting to L5 is about as hard as getting to GTO, the per
      pound cost is $1840 when using the falcon heavy and $3390 when using the falcon 9 (non spacex launch providers
      tend to be much more expensive so they will be ignored). While the Falcon Heavy has had 3 successful launches<a href="#1" class="ref">[7]</a>,
      it is unclear if it can actually be used for the advertised 90 million dollar price. It is disappointing how much
      the pace of space exploration stalled following the end of the Apollo program, however now with innovation from
      the private sector we are finally seeing launch costs decrease.
    </p>
    <img src="table2.png"><a href="#1" class="ref">[1]</a>
    <p>
      The guiding philosophy of what should be brought from earth is heavy simple things are done in space and complex
      little things are done on earth. Even with a very robust industry in space it will be a very long time before it
      is economical to manufacture computer chips in space simply due to their incredible complexity and tiny size. In
      the early stages materials will be harvested from the moon, material like aluminum is readily available on the
      moon. We know this due to the chemical composition of rocks collected on the surface of the moon which consist of
      60% oxygen, 16-17% silicon, 6-10% aluminum, 4-6% calcium, 3-6% magnesium, 2-5% iron, and 1-2% titanium<a href="#1" class="ref">[8]</a>. The
      abundance of oxygen in the rocks also provides a supply of oxygen for the atmosphere of the cylinders. While in
      O’Neill’s time it was still unknown if there was much water on the moon, we now know, “The Moon is really dry. As
      a comparison, the Sahara Desert has 100 times the amount of water than what the SOFIA mission detected in the
      lunar soil”<a href="#1" class="ref">[9]</a>. Given this, a modern attempt at creating O’Neill cylinders will likely still go with the
      originally proposed idea of bringing liquid hydrogen from earth, and then combining it with the oxygen extracted
      from the moon rocks. This results in a 89% reduction of mass required to be launched from Earth for water<a
        href="#1" class="ref">[1]</a>.
      Given the current advances in artificial intelligence and robotics it is likely that creating the first cylinder
      will take a significantly smaller number of people than the 2000 originally thought to be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a largely self-sufficient foothold is established in space, building the next habitat will be significantly
      easier. Labour and expertise will be readily available from the already constructed habitats and the
      infrastructure for constructing the more simple materials will already be in place. Furthermore less specialized
      tools will need to be launched, as many tools from former construction sites will be reused. The hope is that
      eventually there will be enough industry on these cylinders to create new ones with minimal assistance from Earth.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Future In Space</h2>
    <p>
      In the late stages of space colonization Earth will likely become only significant in our hearts, while most of
      the human race lives among the stars. Life in space provides several significant advantages to our Earth bound
      existence which in the long run will expedite the shift over to space.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all it provides near infinite living space, given materials from the asteroid belt we have enough space
      for 78 trillion people. Our population will likely never reach this, and so life in space provides the opportunity
      for all to have very comfortable and spacious living arrangements. Just as our ancestors didn’t dig more caves,
      and instead took the rocks to build homes from the mountains. In our future we won’t live on planets, the moon or
      asteroids, instead we will mine the celestial bodies and construct far more efficient and better habitats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transportation is incredibly cheap and easy when one is already outside of a gravity well. For transportation of
      durable goods, an unpressurized can with some rudimentary engines for acceleration and deceleration is sufficient.
      And for more sensitive goods in humans pressurization of the can and life support systems will suffice. The
      spaceships of the future will likely be roomy, comfortable and inexpensive. Since there is no drag in space the
      trade of will between energy expenditure and time. If we wish to start and end at rest, and assuming half the time
      is spent under constant acceleration and the other half is spent under constant deceleration. we find the
      following relationship:
    </p>
    <div class="katex">
      $$ KE = \frac{2M\Delta X^2}{t^2} $$
    </div>
    <p>
      Where ΔX is the distance traveled and t is the travel time. From this formula we can understand that long distance
      transportation of goods can be done incredibly cheaply at low costs. These costs can be even further reduced by
      using rail gun like launching mechanisms or even low tech catapult like ones. These provide the benefit of no
      longer having to carry your own fuel with you (something that was kept out of the previous calculations for
      simplicity, however this is a big issue if one wishes to get to high speeds).
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally semi-independent space habitats allow for cultural and governmental experimentation. We will likely see a
      plethora of government forms among the habitats. However, their independence will likely lead to more and more
      decentralized forms of governance. This will likely result in thousands of incredibly diverse and independent
      cultures. This does not mean an end to collaboration, it means a reduction in the enforcement of ideals by one
      group onto another. Furthermore conflict between space faring nations will likely be over resources rather than
      the cylinders themselves, which hopefully will lead to a great reduction in civilian casualties.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shift over to space based habitation will eventually result in what is called a Dyson’s Swarm. A Dyson’s
      Swarm is when enough space habitats around the sun and capture its energy to sufficiently dim it. The magnitude of
      such a civilization is incredible, with trillions of people visionaries like Einstein won’t come once every few
      generations, but once every few months. And with cheap and effective transport all around the solar system, it
      will truly be an incredible time to be alive.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      O’Neil’s Original proposal for colonizing space was created in a time when Earth’s population was doubling every
      35 years and many believe mass starvation was around the corner with no clear solution. The harm we were causing
      to Earth's biosphere was starting to be realized, and there was no clear way to fix it. However in 2021 population
      collapse seems inevitable in countries like China which used to be driving such incredible growth and renewables
      and sensible regulation appear to be fully capable of averting a climate disaster, all without causing
      unreasonable economic damage. Which leaves the question, how could we possibly justify such an expensive program,
      despite the fact that Earth appears to be perfectly sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe there are generally three reasons to colonize the final frontier, to explore, to hedge our bets and to
      dream. Exploration is at the core of human psychology, with our distant ancestors crossing frozen straits to
      discover the Americas and spreading themselves to nearly every corner of our world. Exploration provides meaning
      to our lives, it gives school children a reason to study and adults a reason to work. The space race electrified
      our nation and a further round of exploration would be worth it even as an initiative to inspire the next
      generation of scientists. With the barrier to creating nuclear and biological weapons constantly falling as
      technology progresses, having all of the human race in one place will very likely end in disaster. By hedging our
      bets and having many self sufficient human colonies we greatly increase humanities chances of survival. And
      finally, the colonization of the final frontier allows us to dream of a future where every single person lives in
      an idyllic environment with beautiful weather, plentiful food and countless opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      As our launch prices plummet, and America’s interest in space is reigniting we stand at a time which may just mark
      the dawn of a second space age, one where we finally establish a permanent foothold in space.
